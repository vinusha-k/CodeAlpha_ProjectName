TASK 1
Description:
This program is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects one word from a predefined list of five fruits. The player must guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts (6 tries).

Each correct guess reveals the position of the letter in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses all letters or runs out of attempts.

Key Features:

Uses a list of 5 predefined words (e.g., "apple", "banana", "grape", "mango", "peach").

Allows 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

Provides feedback for each guess (correct, wrong, or already guessed).

Console-based, simple input/output â€” no graphics or audio.

Demonstrates Python basics: random, while loops, if-else, strings, and lists.

        
TASK 4
Description:
This chatbot is a Python program that replies to user input using predefined responses. It demonstrates basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and string handling. The chatbot continues to chat until the user types "bye".

Key Features:

Greets the user and responds to basic phrases like "hello" and "how are you".

Simple if-else logic for understanding inputs.

Runs in the console; no external libraries required.

Ends conversation when the user types "bye".

Easy to modify and expand with more responses.
